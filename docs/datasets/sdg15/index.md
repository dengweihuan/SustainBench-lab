# SDG 15: Life on Land

Human activity has altered over 75% of the earth's surface, reducing forest cover, degrading once-fertile land, and threatening an estimated 1 million animal and plant species with extinction [[1]](#references). Our understanding of land cover---i.e., the physical material on the surface of the earth---and its changes is not uniform across the globe. Existing state-of-the-art land cover maps [[2]](#references) are significantly more accurate in high-income regions than low-income ones, as the latter have few ground truth labels [[3]](#references). The datasets included in SustainBench seek to reduce this gap via representation learning and transfer learning.
